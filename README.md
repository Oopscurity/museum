# museum

This is a project initially made as a solution of the educational task. (The section about the task is in progress now.)

*But, of course, it's a little bit more valuable thing.*

The reason is to combine different technologies and tools and to create real-world web application.

The project's roadmap covers:

- [x] React
- [x] HMR integration
- [x] Redux with Immutable.js and Reselect
- [x] React-router
- [ ] Asynchronous routes
- [x] Build configurations for development and production modes
- [ ] Code splitting with Webpack
- [ ] Solution of localization problem
- [ ] Type checking with flow or/and tcomb
- [ ] React components testing with enzyme
- [ ] True code coverage listings
- [x] Konva adaptation (react-konva)
- [x] Express as a web server
- [x] Deploy on Heroku [(link)](https://inf-museum.herokuapp.com)
- [ ] Advanced server configuration (koa)
- [ ] REST API creation and maintaining
- [ ] Database integration and an interface to publish posts
- [ ] Realtime updates with Socket.io
- [ ] Algorithm of tree graph visualization (now it's ugly)
